Changes
=======

0.3.0 (02 Oct 2012)
-------------------

Disable box-shadows and borders around Trac's primary content div --
these extra lines add unwanted noise in LighterTheme.

Elements with class "newform" now have a lavender border instead of 
a green border, which looked ugly.  Also disabled some borders and
box-shadows around newform <h2>s in wikipages; these styles were
introduced in Trac 1.0 and clash with the "newform" styles.

0.2.1 (24 Aug 2012)
-------------------

Added MANIFEST.in file; the distribution now includes the necessary CSS 
assets as well as the code's LICENSE file.

0.2.0 (20 Aug 2012)
-------------------

Fix compatibility with other plugins: previously, this plugin would
cause other plugins' add_stylesheet() calls to break, because of some
incompatibility with Genshi's cut()/buffer() commands.  This is now
fixed by avoiding calls to cut() and buffer()

0.1.0 (19 Aug 2012)
-------------------

Initial release
